ChirpNora is a combined Bachelor (Medialogy) and Master (Sustainable Design) project from Aalborg University Copenhagen, 2015.

ChirpNora have its name from two reference designs:
- [Nora Electric Imp](https://electricimp.com/docs/hardware/resources/reference-designs/nora/): Electric Imp's nora sensor module
- [Chirp](http://wemakethings.net/chirp/): Chirp open-source moisture sensor

Which is combined into one super long battery life plant measuring unit for potential commercial use. In this repository you will find the hardware, firmware and a test software solution that we're working on.
