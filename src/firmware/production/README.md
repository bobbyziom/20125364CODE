# Production firmware

Functional firware for the different iterations of the module.

### v1

Version 1 of the firmware is built on a test environment on a breadboard and a imp001 SD formfaktor module. There is no documentation of the breakout. Therefore this code is no longer maintained, but kept here as a history of progress.

### v2

Version 2 is the current built and is maintained until the next hardware iteration of the project. For more information about features and current functionality go to the firmware v2 section.
